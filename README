# GitHub README for Mistral 7B Instruct Chatbot

## Overview
This repository contains a simple chatbot application developed using Python, Streamlit, and the Mistral 7B Instruct model. The chatbot is designed for conversational image recognition and utilizes the Langchain library for managing chat history.

## Features
- **Conversational Interface**: Users can interact with the chatbot through a user-friendly interface.

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
To avoid conflicts with other projects, it is recommended to create a virtual environment. Follow these steps:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd your_project_directory

# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Required Packages
Once your virtual environment is activated, install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install streamlit langchain transformers torch
```

### 3. Download Mistral 7B Instruct Model from Hugging Face
